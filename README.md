Title: Political Differentiations on gun policy, illegal immigration, abortion and climate change.

Abstract: To what extent do politicians' opinions differentiate on major issues? Gun policy, illegal immigration, abortion and climate change are four subjects of debate that tend to divide lawmakers. Thus, it appears interesting to analyse to what extent there is an ideological split between the different parties (Republican, Democrats) that is identifiable in quotes of politicians. Throughout this journey, it is planned to explore qualitatively the subjectivity of quotes on each subject and analyse the differences between parties. In addition, it is planned to come up with interesting facts to present on these four issues for quantitative conclusions.

Research questions: 
Are Democrats or Republicans personalities associated with positive or negative vocabulary/emotions about gun policy, illegal immigration, abortion and climate change?
Which major attributes of politicians can explain his/her opinion on a precise issue? 
How do quotes about the 4 issues evolve throughout the years? Which other facts are interesting to present about these subjects?

Additional datasets: We will use as a dataset the quotes of elected congressmen between 2016 and 2020. Indeed by selecting elected members we have an objective criteria that defines the political affiliation to the speaker of a quote. 

Also, all congressmen that were not reelected in the midterm 2018 elections or that quitted their position are removed from the dataset. Indeed we want to make sure that each elected official has the same timeframe. 

On top of that, we decided to remove the president and vice president from the dataset. Indeed, news outlets would tend to give more speech time to the president of a nation regardless of his political affiliation. And this would bias the result as the party of the president would be over-represented.

Should we add the 

Methods: 
For research question 1): Handling text (@Badr, t’arrives à rajouter la méthode que tu utilisais?)
For research question 2): Regression analysis
For research question 3): Visualising data with adequate plots


Proposed timeline: 
W9 use QIds to define quotes that belong to one subject + clean data
W10 Initial analysis on the research questions
W11 Final analysis on the research questions
W12 Make nice plots and think of ways to present results
W13 Work on the deliverable aspect

Organization within the team: each of us will take a research question, the last person of the group will take care of defining the quotes that belong to one subject, clean the data and focus on the final deliverable.
Additional info on git: initial analysis were done to understand what was in the data and gives us clues about how to transform the data

Questions: Note that we chose 4 subjects as we are afraid we won’t find anything for some of them. It is possible that analysing the 4 of them will be too much work so we might drop one or two.
